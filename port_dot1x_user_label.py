NAME:           port_dot1x_user_label.py
AUTHORS:        Team Aruba123 (Jeremy Bradrick, Dan Gullick, Greg Kamer, Dan Sinema)
                File location: https://github.com/sinemad/nae-dot1x-port-labeler
CREDITS:        Aruba Networks github NAE ASE scripts (https://github.com/aruba/nae-scripts/blob/master/common/ase/)
                were used as example and code was derived from the following scripts: 
                1. interface_link_state_monitor.1.0.py
                    -   Basic structure used to build this script
                    -   Rule and conditions used as they were the same rule and condition
                        we needed for this script
                    -   Basic callback action functions (basically names as structure was 
                        changed significantly)
                2. vsx_health_monitor.py (rest_get() function)
                    -   Used the rest_get() functions to make the REST query we needed
                3. configuration_change_email.1.1.py
                    -   Used as example on how to process and handle return from rest_get()
                        function
VERSION:        1.0
STATUS:         Active
DESCRIPTION:    This script monitors the up and down state of the ports of a switch. When a interface 
                moves from up to down or down to up, a condition is triggered to discover if the 
                device is authenticated via 802.1x. If the device is authenticated via 802.1x the
                script will then update the interface's description with the 802.1x username. When the
                user disconnects the interface's description is reset. Below is example debug output of
                a user "rpi" authenticating on interface 1/1/1:
                |LOG_DEBUG|================ Up ================
                |LOG_DEBUG|Interface 1/1/1 is up
                |LOG_DEBUG|HTTP GET status: 200
                |LOG_DEBUG|USERNAME: rpi
                |LOG_DEBUG|User rpi logged in on port 1/1/1
                |LOG_DEBUG|COMMAND EXECUTED: config interface 1/1/1 description logged in user - rpi exit exit
                |LOG_DEBUG|COMMAND EXECUTED: show interface 1/1/1
                |LOG_DEBUG|================ Up ================

                Example of the user disconnecting from the interface:
                |LOG_DEBUG|================ Down ================
                |LOG_DEBUG|Interface 1/1/1 is down
                |LOG_DEBUG|COMMAND EXECUTED: config interface 1/1/1 no description exit exit
                |LOG_DEBUG|COMMAND EXECUTED: show interface 1/1/1
                |LOG_DEBUG|================ Down ================

CAVEATS:        1.  The script currently only labels interfaces if the connection is authenticated via
                    802.1x
                2.  Because with NAE scripts we can currently only use the v1 REST interface, we can
                    only trigger on the interface up/down state. If v10.04+ is ever supported there 
                    are REST interfaces that could be used to trigger on user authentication or 
                    reauthentication.
